# ssa-compiler-book

Static single assignment, known as `SSA`, was once developed at IBM Research. Because of its fast and powerful abilities on optimizations, most of the current commercial and open-source compilers, including `LLVM`, `GCC`, `HotSpot`, `V8 engine`, use SSA as a key IR for **program analysis** and other usages. On the other hand, research about **Intermediate Representation** such as MLIR became more mature.    

This book aims to introduce `SSA` and explore its applications in compiler field. 

### Prerequisites

You have to know about **compilers**--(implementations and usages), **static program analysis**--(dataflow and fixed point) and **functional languages**(Ocaml is good).
